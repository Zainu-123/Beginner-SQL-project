# Beginner-SQL-project
## Online Bikestore Management System
### Brief: This project aims to design and implement a comprehensive database system for an online bike store. The system will manage various aspects of the business, including customer information, product details, orders, inventory, and staff management. The primary goal is to create a robust and efficient database structure that supports seamless operations and provides valuable insights for decision-making. This not only streamline the internal processes but also enhance the overall customer experience.
### Objectives: 
#### 1.	Database Design: Design a normalized database schema with relationships to ensure data consistency and integrity.
#### 2.	SQL Implementation: Develop SQL scripts to create tables, enforce constraints, and manage data.
#### 3.	Data population: Populate the appropriate tables with the given datasets.
#### 4.	Query & Reporting: Create SQL queries for extracting valuable insights, such as popular products, customer preferences, and inventory status.
#### 5.	Documentation: Document the project effectively at its different stages.
-	Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD): Include an ERD to visually represent the relationships between database entities (tables).
- Table Descriptions: For each table in the database, provide detailed descriptions of the purpose of the table, key columns, and any constraints. Include information on primary and foreign keys.
- Script Comments: Comment each section of your SQL script to explain its purpose and functionality. Use comments to make the code more readable and understandable. Consider making use of all the SQL commands learned so far and develop sensible scripts making use of joins wherever possible.
- Query Descriptions: Document each SQL query with a clear description of its purpose. Explain what insights or information the query is designed to retrieve.
- Consistency: Maintain consistency in formatting across all documentation. Use a consistent structure, font, and layout.
